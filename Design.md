My client has asked me to create a game that will feature "Mario like game mechanics" with a psychedelic feeling that is going to keep the player either interested, or creeped out.

I'm going to need a lot more information about what the client is thinking about the psychedelic feeling of the game and make sure I meet their specific requirements. I am also going to need more information about the types of objects and the textures of the game, to make sure that I'm touching on every aspect of the clients wished product.

Currently the plan is to get enough information from the client to be able to create a detailed plan of the game, it will then be crutial to make sure that the client agrees with the plan and is happy for me to go into the development stage. During the development of the game I will be using a community edition of a free software called Intellij IDEA, it is a tool that lets developers write code in a much faster manner. I will first start with working on the engine side and then continue on to fixing cosmetic bugs and making sure that the code, and the interface is as readable as possible. After extensively developing the Engine, and having the initial idea of the game ready, I will then use a graphic editing software called Gimp, this software will allow me to create textures, that will be seen in the game and which will ultimately add the theme, and the overall genre of the game.

###Target Audience

The current target audience for this game would be for people over the age of 18, or for anyone who has knowlage/experience of psychedelics before. This game could also be liked by people who enjoyed to fun of playing a platforming game that has a bit of a challange to it in a sense that you have no idea where you are, or what you are even doing at times. As previously said the genre of the game isn't really fixed, although it would be best described as a superimposed remake of a classic mario game and a bad day in the woods.

###Elements

#####Loading screen
Loading screen will feature a 5 second long animation that will show the company's logo, and a little hint as to what the game might entail. After the laoding screen is finished it will lead to the question screen, asking if the user has anything against, or is physically unable to be anywhere with strobing lights, this is to make sure no one accidentally has an epileptic fit and the owner of the game gets sued.

#####Question Screen
Question screen consists of a few questions that user can answer, or choose not to answer, it alternates the gameplay significantly and makes it possible for people who suffer with epilepsy to be able to play the game with no wowrries. The questions would also alternate the difficulty level, or the complexity of the challanges. Once the questions are answered, or skipped they will be stored for later use, this is to avoid the user having to answer the questions more than once.

#####Main menu screen
The main menu will not offer a lot of variety, or oppertunity to do something new, but instead it will act as a linking screen, to join the Options, High scores, and the Game screen together. Upon initial opening of the screen, all of the buttons will be hidden, but over a course of 2 seconds, they will fade in and be visible and clickable for the user. The background of the main menu will be the result of the choices the player made on the question screen, even if the user never made a decision and just skipped.

#####Options screen
This will contain a copy of the Question screen for the user to change any of their given answers, the options screen will also allow the user to set certain settings, like the sound volume, speed of the game, and the difficulty of the game. There will of course be default values set and if the options haven't been changed everything would stay on defautls.

#####Highscores screen
As with almost all of the games, there is going to be a high score element, the high score will be calculated by the end level * amount of total score accumulated by the end of the run.

#####Game screen
The game screen is going to include the actual game, this is where all the logic and behind the scenes work is going to happen. On the top of the screen - in the center, there is going to be a large score meter that will stay there for the whole time that the player is playing the game, this will only increase. To the left side of the score meter there is going to be the wave number. These two objects are going to be the most important thing in the game as the end score relies on them, the higher the level the higher the score multiplier, it would be possible for someone to get a very large score and only have one level complete, or have a very low score and have very many levels complete so the player would be most likely looking forward to trying to get as high of a balance of score and wave level as possible.

The whole general theme of the game would be very casual, with sprites representing a unisex body, with Non playable characters being able to interfere with the player in a way, and with the textures being smooth and calm.

Unlike many other games, there is no ending to this game, as the player will need to play until they either fall, or get trapped. When this happens, the game wraps up and is directed to the highscores screen where the player will get ranked based on their score.
