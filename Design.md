My client has asked me to create a game that will feature "Mario like game mechanics" with a psychedelic feeling that is going to keep the player either interested, or creeped out.

I'm going to need a lot more information about what the client is thinking about the psychedelic feeling of the game and make sure I meet their specific requirements. I am also going to need more information about the types of objects and the textures of the game, to make sure that I'm touching on every aspect of the clients wished product.

Currently the plan is to get enough information from the client to be able to create a detailed plan of the game, it will then be crutial to make sure that the client agrees with the plan and is happy for me to go into the development stage. During the development of the game I will be using a community edition of a free software called Intellij IDEA, it is a tool that lets developers write code in a much faster manner. I will first start with working on the engine side and then continue on to fixing cosmetic bugs and making sure that the code, and the interface is as readable as possible. After extensively developing the Engine, and having the initial idea of the game ready, I will then use a graphic editing software called Gimp, this software will allow me to create textures, that will be seen in the game and which will ultimately add the theme, and the overall genre of the game.

###Target Audience

The current target audience for this game would be for people over the age of 18, or for anyone who has knowlage/experience of psychedelics before. This game could also be liked by people who enjoyed to fun of playing a platforming game that has a bit of a challange to it in a sense that you have no idea where you are at times.
